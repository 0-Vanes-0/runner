signal call_level_end_objects ## Called when finishing level.
signal go_to_portal(portal_position: Vector2) ## Called when a portal is chosen. (WIP: Portal class as argument)
signal in_portal ## Called when player is inside portal.

var player_sensor: PlayerSensor ## Input object for actions with player object.

@export var sprite: AnimatedSprite2D ## Sprite of current demon. (WIP: DemonSkin class)
@export var body_shape: CollisionShape2D ## Body of player, interacting with [Platform].
@export var health_comp: HealthComponent ## Health of player object. When [member HealthComponent.health] reaches 0, player dies.
@export var state_machine: StateMachine ## State machine stores behaviour logic of player object.

@export_group("States", "state_")
@export var state_run: RunPlayerState ## State when player runs.
@export var state_jump_up: JumpUpPlayerState ## State when player jumps up.
@export var state_jump_down: JumpDownPlayerState ## State when player falls or jumps down from platform.
@export var state_dodge: DodgePlayerState ## State when dodge is active.
@export var state_dead: DeadPlayerState ## State when [member HealthComponent.health] is 0.
@export var state_level_end: LevelEndPlayerState ## State when level is finished.

var jump_speed: float ## Describes how fast player jumps in pixels. Depends on [member gravity], do not change this value outside [method prepare_to_run]!
var run_speed: float ## Describes how fast [Segment]s are moving in pixels (player doesn't move horizontally actually :P ).
var dodge_time: float ## Describes how long is [DodgePlayerState].
var stamina: float ## This value is spent on jumps and dodges. Restores during [RunPlayerState].
var stamina_max: float ## Maximum value of [member stamina].

var platforms_left: int ## Simple counter of platforms left to finish a level.
var weapon: Weapon ## Equipped [Weapon].

## The more it is, the faster player moves vertically. Default value is here: [code]ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")[/code]
