- Player's "dodge" animation must be not looping
- Simple enemies (shooting, moving up and down)
- Add to ShootEntity functions for inherited children? (?)
- Maybe redo shoot entity resources and remove additional classes?

+ Add rotation to ProjectileLinearSER
+ Add platforms
+ Add Weapon class and give one obj to Player
